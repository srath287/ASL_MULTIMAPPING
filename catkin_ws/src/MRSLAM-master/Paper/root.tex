\begin{abstract}

In this paper we present and implement the algorithm in Howard's 2006 paper: ``Multi-robot simultaneous localization and mapping using particle filters.''  While Howard's method is attractive for its speed, it combines the forward and reverse particle weights, which can result in undesired particle error.  In this paper we propose a modification of the algorithm by using independent particle filters for each robot, and demonstrate that the modified algorithm provides a qualitatively better map, and a more accurate pose estimate.
